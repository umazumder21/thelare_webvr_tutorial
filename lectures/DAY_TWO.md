## Session 2 - Introduce Javascript and embedding files

  - walk them through the example branch
  - setup javascript/style linter on your own files, students will need this (atom, install package, etc) (maybe teach command shift p, out of scope)
  - students should display an image via google's api before moving forward.
  - you're going to have to show them the console as a debugging tool (only console, don't go deep into everything else)
